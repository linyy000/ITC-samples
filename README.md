Individual Tree Crown（ITC）Sample Set in the Taiga-Tundra Ecotone

This dataset contains vector files and corresponding remote sensing images of individual tree crown samples from nine regions within the Taiga-Tundra ecotone. It is valuable for various ecological and environmental studies, including vegetation analysis, carbon sequestration modeling, and biodiversity assessments. The vector files delineate and provide the crown area of individual tree crowns, with each file corresponding to a specific region in the dataset. The remote sensing images are a combination of Near-Infrared (NIR), Red, Green, and Canopy Height Model (CHM) bands.

The dataset is structured into vector files available in formats such as Shapefile (.shp), GeoJSON, and other compatible formats, along with remote sensing images in raster formats like GeoTIFF (.tif). To use this dataset, download the files from the GitHub repository and open them in any compatible GIS or remote sensing software.
